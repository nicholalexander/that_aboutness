Bloop is the best.  It means everything and nothing and is easy to skip over.  Much like so many other things.  I use it in psudo code and it is friendly.  It does not demand attention.  It is a variable, a class, a method, a file, and sometimes an exclimation!  Bloop!  When there needs to be more of these things, Blonk, Bleep, and Bloof sometimes come in.

Oh man, it's been a minute.

Some years have passed.  In the intervening time I have worked at a dream consultancy, worked on some crazy projects, worked with a dream team fintech company, and am now onto the next thing.  Along the way I might have learned some things, maybe I will be able to share them here with you.

I have not made time for this blog obviously.  But time has not allowed time to be made for this blog.  I'm currently on a 25 day break between gigs and its the first time I've been able to think about things.  

I'd like to make more time.
