On July 9, 2011, I made a list of things I was afraid of at the time.  They included but were not limited to:

>* republicans  
>* cars with NJ license plates  
>* unpasteurized goat milk  
>* robots (in general)  
>* technology  
>* deer  
>* the dark  
>* the night  
>* wind  
>* especially dark windy nights  
>* the moon  
>* hawks  
>* bears  
>* scorpions  
>* rattle snakes  
>* wasps  
>* hornets  
>* tarantulas / all spiders / anything with more than 3 legs  
>* flocks of birds, any kind, but sparrows particularly (they have such sharp beaks!)  
>* swans (they can break a manâ€™s leg with their neck!)  
>* comas  
>* people with power  
>* people with influence  
>* people with money  
>* people  
>* bed bath and beyond  
>* ikea  
>* malls  
>* lightning / any form of uncontrolled electricity  
>* solar flares  
>* asteroids  
>* nuclear weapons  
>* the bible  
>* terrorists  
>* plastic flamingos  
>* herds of cows  
>* fire ants  
>* poison ivy  
>* any weapon of any kind, but especially guns, catapults, tanks, and horses  
>* cats / lions / hyenas / anything that lives on the serengeti  
>* weevils  
>* anything microscopic, especially atoms.  

I suppose that if you were to organize these into broad categories, you'd get:   

* Animals (including and especially People)
* Nature  
* Ideology
* Capitalisim  

Basically that's pretty much it.  

I also suppose it is good to remember what it is that scares you in the world.
