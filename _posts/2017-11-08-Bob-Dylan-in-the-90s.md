One night in 98 or maybe 97, I landed at JFK and took a taxi in to the city in time to catch Bob Dylan play MSG and it was the first time I'd ever seen him and he had something special then that night, something of that genius, well worn and well practiced and I haven't heard it so much in the last few years but I remember it and when you hear it, you know it.  I was with my dad and brother and mother and I was wearing a long black coat, of course.  It's a good memory to have and makes me wonder if maybe the 90s was his last great run.  I'm gonna miss him when he's gone but in the meantime, here's what I remember it sounded like back then.
