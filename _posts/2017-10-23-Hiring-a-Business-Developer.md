Questions to ask, and some guidance on answers

What is the best programming language? Why? 
should be somewhat agnostic on languages. if they have strong feelings they should be clearly presented as *preferences*. bonus points for mentioning hiring - choosing a popular language will make hiring easier down the line.

How much downtime is acceptable? 
The answer should address the *cost* of downtime. Everyone hates the idea of the website going down but whether or not it’s a catastrophe depends on how much it costs your business. For a website grossing $20K/month, downtime only costs $28/hour.

outsourced API’s vs custom built?
should address the core competency of the business

Do you want to manage hardware? Infrastructure costs vs. other costs?
For a non-technical startup there almost never a reason to even think about hardware.

How to move from chaos to closed paths? TK

not possible

How you avoid tech debt? 
you don’t

The general rule 
You should be able to understand their answers.
