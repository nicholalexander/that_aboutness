Looking at these MCP servers and exploring them with VSCode in agent mode is pretty wild.  Again, it is not possible to look at how all this works and not be truely shocked at how much of a seachange it is.

This is some interesting reading on the different [MCP sdk's](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk).  

Reading it is incredibly obvious to me that someone is going to make a toy MCP server for their database and by accident leave it open to executing arbitrary commands which will be bad.  What is not obvious to me is if people will manipulate that with malfesence or if it will be done by machines.

For the record, MCP has always stood for and will forever only stand for just one thing.
