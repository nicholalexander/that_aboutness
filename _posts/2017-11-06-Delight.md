blurb: A few lessons I learned from the CTO of Spoon University about incorporating delight into your product.
---

A near infinite amount of pixelated ink has been spilled around the idea of "delight" in digital products: how to achieve it, what it is, why you want it, what it's for, what it does, etc and *ad infinitum*.  And of course, being desirious of delight and all its magic promise, I had read up on it, longingly.  But as design and color coordination are ungraspable concepts to me, foreign as some far distant shore, delight and its digital manifestation had elluded me.  

For example, [here is a website](http://www.dokimos.org/ajff/) I might have previously possibly thought of as potentially delightful, depending upon tastes, I suppose.  I especially like the jaunty tune and the sweetly flying dove.  Absolutely delightful!

That was until, of course, I found myself at Spoon University working with Sarah Adler, the founder and CTO of the company.  She has an ability to connect with users and find moments of delightfulness that seems to be natural, organic, and spontaneous.  The result was that over the course of working with her I came to see demonstrated the actual patterns that lead to the creation of delight and it is here that I wish to share some of those lessons with you, dear reader.

## Who is it you hope to delight?

Yourself?  Oh, hahahah, you delightful fool, surely delighting yourself is no big challenge!  I am delighted by spinny things and flashy things and things that happen on servers.  But why should you, the user, be in the least bit interested in these things?  These are things that I find delightful, but it is my job to discover and make available that which YOU might find delightful.  

I think it's so hard to have that distinction at the forefront of your mind, especially given that when I am in the midst of building something and I build something "cool", it is personally very exciting.  Finding the ability to separate yourself from that and ask who your users are and what they might find delightful is crucial to knowing if you have something of value for them.

## Purpose

Your users are trying desperately to do something.  Always.  And if you delight them or not is irrelevant if you are not helping them achieve their goal.  You can not divorce the accomplishment of a goal from delight.  

This wonderous dropdown full of pithy copy and subtle colors means nothing if it is not directly responsible for helping you achieve one of your goals in using this website.  

This was often hard for me to remember as it was tempting to sprinkle a bit of delight here or a bit there.  I think in those cases it just becomes a distraction and weighs down the site with a burdonsomeness which doesn't make anyone happy.

## Surprise

The element of surprise is very imporantant.  I found that at Spoon, that suprise often came in the form of copy or microcopy as some have called it.  A

Microcopy.  Functionality.  How things are revealed.
