A long time ago I wrote down a bunch of things which was helpful mostly to me.  And then, for a long time, I relegated that task to others and wrote down some things for other people to read but let other people be in charge of those other things.

Then, recently, I decided I was bored of that and wanted to really write down some things about other things and I wanted those things to be mine and not sell ads against them and not allow Russian bots to interact with them and to have them in "files" on a "server" that could be accessed via the open and free web.

So I made this thing!  With the help of [these people](https://jekyllrb.com).  Of course it took me too long and involved shaving too many yaks but I enjoyed shaving those yaks and did so willingly and with great joy.  Read about [shaving yaks]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-10-19-shaving-the-yak.md %}).

Of note, this is not theaboutness.  theaboutness was a thing I also did from a long time ago that I wish I'd kept doing but now is gone.  You can find things from it on the waybackmachine and maybe someday I'll recreate some of those good old posts here.
