I"“<p>I was sitting drinking a rum punch, as I am want to do, and behind me these loud obnoxious entitled teachers from a nearby unnamed <a href="http://www.generationschools.org/">charter school</a> were mocking their students and their parents and their administrators. From jokes about do-rags to autisim they over and over demonstrated a callous disregard for their students and their school. It was so grating to listen to their ranting that I was moved to anger and rage.  And accordingly, I chose to avoid the conflict, down my rum punch, and move along. Shame, too, as the weather was particularly nice and I had hoped to enjoy some sun with my rum.</p>
