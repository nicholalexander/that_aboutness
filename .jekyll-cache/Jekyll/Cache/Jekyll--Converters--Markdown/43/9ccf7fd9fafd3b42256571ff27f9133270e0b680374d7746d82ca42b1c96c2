I"≠<p>A long time ago I wrote down a bunch of things which was helpful mostly to me.  And then, for a long time, I relegated that task to others and wrote down some things for other people to read but let other people be in charge of those other things.</p>

<p>Then, recently, I decided I was bored of that and wanted to really write down some things about other things and I wanted those things to be mine and not sell ads against them and not allow Russian bots to interact with them and to have them in ‚Äúfiles‚Äù on a ‚Äúserver‚Äù that could be accessed via the open and free web.</p>

<p>So I made this thing!  With the help of these <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">jekylls</a>.  Of course it took me too long and involved shaving too many yaks but I enjoyed shaving those yaks and did so willingly and with great joy.  Read about 
<a href="/2017/10/19/shaving-the-yak/">shaving yaks</a>.</p>

<p>Of note, this is not the aboutness.  The aboutness was a thing I also did from a long time ago that I wish I‚Äôd kept doing but now is gone.  You can find things from it on the waybackmachine and maybe someday I‚Äôll recreate some of those good old posts here.</p>
