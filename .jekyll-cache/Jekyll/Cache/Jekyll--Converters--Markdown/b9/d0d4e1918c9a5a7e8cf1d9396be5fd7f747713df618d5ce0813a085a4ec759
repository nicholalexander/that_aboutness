I"‰<p>I recently started working with <a href="http://shoesrb.com">Shoes</a> as part of making a game and being inspired to do so by some talks at RubyConf.  Shoes is an awesome little toolkit for making GUI interfaces for your code, written in Ruby.  I also recently had need to make a rainbow using Shoes and thought it might be a helpful exercise to write up my process to share with you.</p>
