I"©<p>So I had this interview with this guy the other day.  What an asshole.  He wasn‚Äôt really.  Or was he?  Regardless, what a terrible interview.  I did terrible.  He asked me a dumb white board question, the answer to which was this:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">upto</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">upto</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="o">|</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">y</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="nb">print</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ooooooh, that‚Äôs so hard!  And that‚Äôs why I was completely unable to remember any syntax or pretty much anything.  I froze.  Total. Brain. Collapse.  And I was half thinking the whole time, I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve been asked to nest a for loop.  And then of course I was only thinking about that and then about how I was not thinking about the loop and then‚Ä¶ wait, in Ruby‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs a block?</p>

<p>Jesu.  Then he gives me two tables in a database!  And says how would I find all the users who had a given subscription.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">users</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">subscriptions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">name</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">name</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">email</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">email</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>And what I should have said was: I‚Äôd write a migration to setup a relation between the tables so I could use ActiveRecord like it‚Äôs supposed to be (the app was a Rails one so that would sort of makes sense that they would maybe have ActiveRecord) so that I could do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subscription.users</code> like every other rails developer in the world and why don‚Äôt you have that set up in the first place?!</p>

<p>What I said instead was ‚Äúoh um well I don‚Äôt know the exact sql syntax and you‚Äôd have to do a select all from a join or something‚Äù and instead sounded like an idiot.  And though I am fully capable of perhaps figuring out the raw sql command it was not at hand to my dumb and spinning brain and instead of telling this guy his two questions were dumb, I left angry and belittled.</p>

<p>I hate pop quizes.  I have never given one in an interview and I never will.  What a dumb way to hire people.  I really really think that.</p>
