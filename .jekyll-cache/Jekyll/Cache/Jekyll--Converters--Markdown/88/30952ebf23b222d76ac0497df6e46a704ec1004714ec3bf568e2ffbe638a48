I"ô<p>Localhost.  Itâ€™s local and itâ€™s a host but what good does that do you when you want to check in on your locally runnying jekyll blog that only you read from your bed on your phone?</p>

<p>Easy peasy.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">jekyll</span> <span class="n">serve</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">host</span> <span class="mf">0.0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mf">0.0</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then run up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ifconfig</code> (assuming youâ€™re mac-ing) and look for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inet</code> on your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">en0</code> interface.  Thatâ€™s your IP on your network.  On mine, itâ€™s 10.0.1.95 and this is what it looks like:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/serve_jekyll_on_wifi/ifconfig_screenshot.png" alt="ifconfig.png" /></p>

<p>Now make sure your phone is on the same wifi network, hit http://10.0.1.95:4000 from your phone andâ€¦ oh yeah.  Your sweet sweet blog.  Just for you.  From your computer via wifi to your phone.  Pretty soon youâ€™re gonna be your own ISP, amirite?</p>

<p>Yes, but why?  When Jekyll runs locally it defaults to only listening for traffic on localhost, which only comes fromâ€¦ localâ€¦ host?  So if you want that webrick listening on your actual ethernet channel for connections, set it to 0.0.0.0 and that does the trick!</p>
