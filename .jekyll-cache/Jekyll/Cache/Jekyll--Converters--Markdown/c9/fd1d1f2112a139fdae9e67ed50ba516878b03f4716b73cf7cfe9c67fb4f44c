I"í<p>One night in 98 or maybe 97, I landed at JFK and took a taxi in to the city in time to catch Bob Dylan play MSG and it was the first time Iâ€™d ever seen him and he had something special then that night, something of that genius, well worn and well practiced and I havenâ€™t heard it so much in the last few years but I remember it and when you hear it, you know it.  I was with my dad and brother and mother and I was wearing a long black coat, of course.  Itâ€™s a good memory to have and makes me wonder if maybe the 90s was his last great run.  Iâ€™m gonna miss him when heâ€™s gone but in the meantime, hereâ€™s what I remember it sounded like back then.</p>
