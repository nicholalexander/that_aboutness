I"þ<p>On July 9, 2011, I made a list of things I was afraid of at the time.  They included but were not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>republicans</li>
  <li>cars with NJ license plates</li>
  <li>unpasteurized goat milk</li>
  <li>robots (in general)</li>
  <li>technology</li>
  <li>deer</li>
  <li>the dark</li>
  <li>the night</li>
  <li>wind</li>
  <li>especially dark windy nights</li>
  <li>the moon</li>
  <li>hawks</li>
  <li>bears</li>
  <li>scorpions</li>
  <li>rattle snakes</li>
  <li>wasps</li>
  <li>hornets</li>
  <li>tarantulas / all spiders / anything with more than 3 legs</li>
  <li>flocks of birds, any kind, but sparrows particularly (they have such sharp beaks!)</li>
  <li>swans (they can break a manâ€™s leg with their neck!)</li>
  <li>comas</li>
  <li>people with power</li>
  <li>people with influence</li>
  <li>people with money</li>
  <li>people</li>
  <li>bed bath and beyond</li>
  <li>ikea</li>
  <li>malls</li>
  <li>lightning / any form of uncontrolled electricity</li>
  <li>solar flares</li>
  <li>asteroids</li>
  <li>nuclear weapons</li>
  <li>the bible</li>
  <li>terrorists</li>
  <li>plastic flamingos</li>
  <li>herds of cows</li>
  <li>fire ants</li>
  <li>poison ivy</li>
  <li>any weapon of any kind, but especially guns, catapults, tanks, and horses</li>
  <li>cats / lions / hyenas / anything that lives on the serengeti</li>
  <li>weevils</li>
  <li>anything microscopic, especially atoms.</li>
</ul>

<p>I suppose that if you were to organize these into broad categories, youâ€™d get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Animals (including and especially People)</li>
  <li>Nature</li>
  <li>Ideology</li>
  <li>Capitalisim</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically thatâ€™s pretty much it.</p>

<p>I also suppose it is good to remember what it is that scares you in the world.</p>
