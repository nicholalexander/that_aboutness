I"„<p>Over the last several months Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to look for a job which has been both fun and, of course, frustrating.  For the first time in my career, tech or otherwise, Iâ€™ve been in a position where I didnâ€™t have to say yes to the first thing that came along and where Iâ€™ve been able to say no to places I didnâ€™t feel were a good fit for me for whatever reason.</p>
